        { name: "Teresa E.", review: "I came here for a 2nd option and was so scared it would be the same information. As soon as I got here they greeted me and I filled out a few minutes of paperwork and I was in to see Dr. Hentges. He took a couple of X-rays and within a few minutes he was explaining everything. He got right to the point and was very knowledgeable about my situation and referred me to a periodontist to get the exact professional I personally needed. Dr. Hentges was calm and confident gentle and reassuring. I will be bringing the family here from now on. Thank you Dr. Hentges your the best dentist I have ever been to and look forward to coming to you for all my family's dental needs." },
        { name: "Lillie D.", review: "I don't think I've ever had a more thorough teeth cleaning. Everything from scheduling to cleaning to diagnosis was quick and done efficiently. Everyone is kind and willing to help. Love it!" },
        { name: "Colette C.", review: "Amazing experience. I go every 6 months. He is honest and a wonderful dentist and man. Their office is efficient and clean and very personable. I recommend everyone to go to him. I love their hygienist and staff. They are efficient and always remember who I am. The front desk is always happy and considerate especially Leslie and the new Dr. Zack [sic] is very good. The hygienist is so good and never makes me feel uncomfortable" }
